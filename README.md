3DR
===

3DR is a RepRap Delta printer. Designed by Richard Horne (Aka RichRap)

The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossell and Tantillus 3D printers.

It's been performing well since May 2013 â€“ but should be considered a work in progress.

The files here are provided for you to print, build, experiment and evolve the design how you choose, please share your experiences and let me know if you build one.

##### Instructions

Print with Hexagon Infill and stop at whatever height you like before the top prints 
Giving you a nice little house for bees.

Experiment with different levels of infill but around 8% to 20% seem to give a good size.

You can print many and at different heights, their is a middle section and you could print ones to go all around it.
