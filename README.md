3DR
===

3DR is a RepRap Delta printer. Designed by Richard Horne (Aka RichRap)

The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossell and Tantillus 3D printers.

It's been performing well since May 2013 â€“ but should be considered a work in progress.

The files here are provided for you to print, build, experiment and evolve the design how you choose, please share your experiences and let me know if you build one.

Further assembly, sourcing and pictorial information will become available on www.richrap.com and www.richrap.blogspot.com


Many thanks,

Rich.
